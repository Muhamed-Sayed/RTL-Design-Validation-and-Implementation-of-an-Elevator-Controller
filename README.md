# RTL-Design-Validation-and-Implementation-of-an-Elevator-Controller

## The objectives of this project are:
o RTL Design of an elevator controller using VHDL.
o Validation of the design using self-checking testbenches and simulation.
o The hardware implementation and validation of the elevator controller using the Terasic DE0-CV development board.
